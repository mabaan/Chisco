ðŸ”§ Data Preparation Command Line Tool - The Easy Button

This is your simple command-line tool to prepare EEG data for machine learning.
Just run one command and watch as your raw CSV files get transformed into 
clean training data!

What it does:
- Takes a folder full of messy EEG CSV files
- Calls the data_imagine.py "kitchen" to cook them into clean data
- Lets you choose how much overlap between time windows you want
- Splits your data into train/validation/test sets
- Does all the heavy lifting so you don't have to

Usage example:
python preprocessing.py --root data/AREEG_Words --overlap 0.75

Think of this as the "easy button" that does all the boring data prep work
so you can focus on training cool AI models!
